# Project Memories

This file contains important project knowledge, patterns, and learnings that help maintain consistency and efficiency across coding sessions.

## 1. Project Overview

### Initial Project Setup

- **Context**: Initial creation of the cursor-ai-rules project
- **Pattern/Solution**: Project organized around rule-based AI assistance with standardized rule formats
- **Rationale**: Structured approach to managing AI behavior and maintaining consistent coding standards
- **Added**: 2024-02-22

## 2. Code Patterns

### Memory System Validation

- **Context**: Testing the memory system functionality
- **Pattern/Solution**: To validate memory entries:
  1. Add a test entry with specific, unique information
  2. Reference this information in a future interaction
  3. Verify the AI can correctly recall and apply the information
- **Rationale**: Ensures the memory system can effectively store and retrieve project knowledge
- **Examples**: This entry itself serves as a test case - try asking about "memory validation steps" in a future interaction
- **Added**: 2024-02-22

### Rule File Structure

- **Context**: Standard structure for rule files in the project
- **Pattern/Solution**: All rule files must include:
  - Frontmatter with description and globs
  - Metadata section with version and dependencies
  - Clear sections for guidelines and instructions
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistency and maintainability across all rule files
- **Examples**: See `rule-standards.mdc` for the complete specification
- **Added**: 2024-02-22
